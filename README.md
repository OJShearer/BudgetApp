# BudgetApp
Goal - create a budget app using a class, with functionality of depositing, withdrawing, and transferring into budgets.
Built upon this with read and write functionality, so amounts are stored across sessions.
Added a session history method, detailing all actions within a session.

App runs through the app2.py file.
